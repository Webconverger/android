**UNDER DEVELOPMENT** -- NOT FOR USE YET

# Why is Webconverger better than the competition?

* Opensource - absolutely transparent. Calling for peer preview. Accountable. Trustworthy. Leading Opensource kiosk effort since 2007.
* Long term: Same [API](https://webconverger.org/API/) so it doesn't matter what device (PC or Android) you use to setup a Digital Sign or interactive Web terminal.

Locked down with [Android
5.0](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html) features
such as Managed provisioning over NFC & [Screen
Pinning](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenPinning).

"Managed provisioning over NFC" should help setup many devices quickly without
need for a Google Account.

# Development setup and dependencies

Using Android Studio 1.0.2 and Android 5.0 (Lollipop)

<http://stackoverflow.com/a/20068221/4534> might help if you have "cannot resolve symbol R" issue.

* Nexus 7 running Android 5.0 Lollipop

# Competitors

Not Opensource:

* [Android Kiosk](http://www.android-kiosk.com/) - 5GBP
* Android Kioware - don't publish their pricing

# Configuration service business model

Webconverger's business model like the PC version we will ask for payment to
remotely administer the kiosk via <https://config.webconverger.com/> to
maintain/develop both PC & Android versions long into the future.
